24	0.5.0	Why Scripture Promises Are So Important for Our Prayers
25	（Gen 31:2）	When Jacob saw the look on Laban’s face, he could tell his attitude toward him had changed.
26	（Gen 32:12）	But you said, ‘I will certainly make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand on the seashore, too numerous to count.’”
27	（Gen 32:9）	Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O Lord, you said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives and I will make you prosper.’
28	（2Cor 1:20）	For every one of God’s promises are “Yes” in him; therefore also through him the “Amen” is spoken, to the glory we give to God.
29	（2Cor 6:1）	Now because we are fellow workers, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
30	（2Cor 6:16）	And what mutual agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said, “I will live in them and will walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”
31	（Lev 26:12）	I will walk among you, and I will be your God and you will be my people.
32	（Exod 32:27）	and he said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said ‘Each man fasten his sword on his side, and go back and forth from entrance to entrance throughout the camp, and each one kill his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.’”
33	（Isa 52:11）	Leave! Leave! Get out of there! Don’t touch anything unclean! Get out of it! Stay pure, you who carry the Lord’s holy items!
34	（2Cor 7:1）	Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that could defile the body and the spirit, and thus accomplish holiness out of reverence for God.
35	（Gal 3:16）	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. Scripture does not say, “and to the descendants,” referring to many, but “and to your descendant,” referring to one, who is Christ.
36	（Gal 3:29）	And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants, heirs according to the promise.
37	0.6.0	Four Important Truths
38	0.6.1	Promises will only and always mean what they mean in their context and with the intent with which they were written.
39	（Matt 4:5-7）	Then the devil took him to the holy city, had him stand on the highest point of the temple,and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you’ and ‘with their hands they will lift you up, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”Jesus said to him, “Once again it is written: ‘You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’”
40	0.6.2	Promises sometimes have a multiple fulfillment in the past, present and future.
41	（Joel 2:29-32）	Even on male and female servants I will pour out my Spirit in those days.I will produce portents both in the sky and on the earth – blood, fire, and columns of smoke.The sunlight will be turned to darkness and the moon to the color of blood, before the day of the Lord comes – that great and terrible day!It will so happen that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be delivered. For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who survive, just as the Lord has promised; the remnant will be those whom the Lord will call.
42	（Acts 2:15）	In spite of what you think, these men are not drunk, for it is only nine o’clock in the morning.
43	（Rev 6:12）	Then I looked when the Lamb opened the sixth seal, and a huge earthquake took place; the sun became as black as sackcloth made of hair, and the full moon became blood red;
44	（Isa 7:10-16）	The Lord again spoke to Ahaz:“Ask for a confirming sign from the Lord your God. You can even ask for something miraculous.”But Ahaz responded, “I don’t want to ask; I don’t want to put the Lord to a test.”So Isaiah replied, “Pay attention, family of David. Do you consider it too insignificant to try the patience of men? Is that why you are also trying the patience of my God?For this reason the Lord himself will give you a confirming sign. Look, this young woman is about to conceive and will give birth to a son. You, young woman, will name him Immanuel.He will eat sour milk and honey, which will help him know how to reject evil and choose what is right.Here is why this will be so: Before the child knows how to reject evil and choose what is right, the land whose two kings you fear will be desolate.
45	（Matt 1:21-23）	She will give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled:“Look! The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will name him Emmanuel,” which means “God with us.”
46	0.6.3	Promises that are conditional always require fulfillment of the condition before the promise is granted.
47	（Ps 50:14-15）	Present to God a thank-offering! Repay your vows to the Most High!Pray to me when you are in trouble! I will deliver you, and you will honor me!”
48	（Matt 6:33）	But above all pursue his kingdom and righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
49	0.6.4	Promises that are granted are sometimes delayed for many years.
50	（Ps 69:13）	O Lord, may you hear my prayer and be favorably disposed to me! O God, because of your great loyal love, answer me with your faithful deliverance!
51	（Heb 6:15）	And so by persevering, Abraham inherited the promise.
52	0.7.0	Living Before the Face of God
53	（Ps 89:15-16）	How blessed are the people who worship you! O Lord, they experience your favor.They rejoice in your name all day long, and are vindicated by your justice.
54	（Gal 5:25）	If we live by the Spirit, let us also behave in accordance with the Spirit.
55	0.7.{6}.1	Presenting Ourselves to God
56	（1Pet 2:23）	When he was maligned, he did not answer back; when he suffered, he threatened no retaliation, but committed himself to God who judges justly.
57	（1Pet 2:21）	For to this you were called, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving an example for you to follow in his steps.
58	（1Pet 4:19）	So then let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator as they do good.
59	（Ps 31:5）	Into your hand I entrust my life; you will rescue me, O Lord, the faithful God.
60	（Luke 23:46）	Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” And after he said this he breathed his last.

65	（Ps 62:5）	Patiently wait for God alone, my soul! For he is the one who gives me hope.
66	（Ps 141:8）	Surely I am looking to you, O Sovereign Lord. In you I take shelter. Do not expose me to danger!
67	（Ps 73:28）	But as for me, God’s presence is all I need. I have made the Sovereign Lord my shelter, as I declare all the things you have done.
68	（Ps 123:1-2）	A song of ascents. I look up toward you, the one enthroned in heaven.Look, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a female servant look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes will look to the Lord, our God, until he shows us favor.
69	（Col 3:23）	Whatever you are doing, work at it with enthusiasm, as to the Lord and not for people,
70	（Ps 37:5）	Commit your future to the Lord! Trust in him, and he will act on your behalf.
71	（Ps 26:1）	By David. Vindicate me, O Lord, for I have integrity, and I trust in the Lord without wavering.
72	（Ps 119:55）	I remember your name during the night, O Lord, and I will keep your law.
73	（Ps 31:5）	Into your hand I entrust my life; you will rescue me, O Lord, the faithful God.
74	（Job 5:8）	“But as for me, I would seek God, and to God I would set forth my case.
75	（Isa 26:8-9）	Yes, as your judgments unfold, O Lord, we wait for you. We desire your fame and reputation to grow.I look for you during the night, my spirit within me seeks you at dawn, for when your judgments come upon the earth, those who live in the world learn about justice.
76	（Ps 39:7）	But now, O Lord, upon what am I relying? You are my only hope!
77	（Ps 71:14）	As for me, I will wait continually, and will continue to praise you.
78	（Rom 6:13）	and do not present your members to sin as instruments to be used for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead and your members to God as instruments to be used for righteousness.
79	（Rom 12:1）	Therefore I exhort you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a sacrifice – alive, holy, and pleasing to God – which is your reasonable service.
80	（1Pet 2:23）	When he was maligned, he did not answer back; when he suffered, he threatened no retaliation, but committed himself to God who judges justly.
81	（1Pet 4:19）	So then let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator as they do good.
82	（Ps 90:1）	A prayer of Moses, the man of God. O Lord, you have been our protector through all generations!

86	（Heb 10:5-7）	So when he came into the world, he said, “Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me.“Whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you took no delight in.“Then I said, ‘Here I am: I have come – it is written of me in the scroll of the book – to do your will, O God.’”
87	（Matt 26:39）	Going a little farther, he threw himself down with his face to the ground and prayed, “My Father, if possible, let this cup pass from me! Yet not what I will, but what you will.”
88	（Matt 26:42）	He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will must be done.”
89	（Phil 4:11-13）	I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content in any circumstance.I have experienced times of need and times of abundance. In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of contentment, whether I go satisfied or hungry, have plenty or nothing.I am able to do all things through the one who strengthens me.
90	（Rom 8:28-29）	And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose,because those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.

96	（Job 23:8-10）	“If I go to the east, he is not there, and to the west, yet I do not perceive him.In the north when he is at work, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I see no trace of him.But he knows the pathway that I take; if he tested me, I would come forth like gold.
97	（Ps 77:19）	You walked through the sea; you passed through the surging waters, but left no footprints.
98	（Jer 10:23）	Lord, we know that people do not control their own destiny. It is not in their power to determine what will happen to them.

100	（Ps 16:5-6）	Lord, you give me stability and prosperity; you make my future secure.It is as if I have been given fertile fields or received a beautiful tract of land.

145	（Mark 12:24）	Jesus said to them, “Aren’t you deceived for this reason, because you don’t know the scriptures or the power of God?

147	（Josh 23:14）	“Look, today I am about to die. You know with all your heart and being that not even one of all the faithful promises the Lord your God made to you is left unfulfilled; every one was realized – not one promise is unfulfilled!

153	（John 10:35）	If those people to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’ (and the scripture cannot be broken),
154	（Rev 22:6）	Then the angel said to me, “These words are reliable and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen soon.”
155	（Matt 24:35）	Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
156	（2Pet 1:19）	Moreover, we possess the prophetic word as an altogether reliable thing. You do well if you pay attention to this as you would to a light shining in a murky place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
157	（Prov 30:5）	Every word of God is purified; he is like a shield for those who take refuge in him.
158	（2Tim 2:13）	If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, since he cannot deny himself.
159	（Ps 93:5）	The rules you set down are completely reliable. Holiness aptly adorns your house, O Lord, forever.
160	（Heb 6:17-19）	In the same way God wanted to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise that his purpose was unchangeable, and so he intervened with an oath,so that we who have found refuge in him may find strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us through two unchangeable things, since it is impossible for God to lie.We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, sure and steadfast, which reaches inside behind the curtain,
161	（1Thess 5:24）	He who calls you is trustworthy, and he will in fact do this.

164	（Deut 32:4）	As for the Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are just. He is a reliable God who is never unjust, he is fair and upright.
165	（Ps 145:13）	Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations.
166	（Ps 111:7）	His acts are characterized by faithfulness and justice; all his precepts are reliable.
167	（Isa 49:7）	This is what the Lord, the protector of Israel, their Holy One, says to the one who is despised and rejected by nations, a servant of rulers: “Kings will see and rise in respect, princes will bow down, because of the faithful Lord, the Holy One of Israel who has chosen you.”
168	（1Cor 1:9）	God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
169	（2Thess 3:3）	But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one.
170	（1Kgs 8:15）	He said, “The Lord God of Israel is worthy of praise because he has fulfilled what he promised my father David.
171	1.2.{3}	Promises to Those Who Trust God
172	（Ps 9:10）	Your loyal followers trust in you, for you, Lord, do not abandon those who seek your help.
173	（Jer 17:7-8）	My blessing is on those people who trust in me, who put their confidence in me.They will be like a tree planted near a stream whose roots spread out toward the water. It has nothing to fear when the heat comes. Its leaves are always green. It has no need to be concerned in a year of drought. It does not stop bearing fruit.
174	（Nah 1:7）	The Lord is good – indeed, he is a fortress in time of distress, and he protects those who seek refuge in him.
175	（Heb 10:35）	So do not throw away your confidence, because it has great reward.
176	（Matt 8:13）	Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; just as you believed, it will be done for you.” And the servant was healed at that hour.
177	（Acts 10:43）	About him all the prophets testify, that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”
178	（Acts 13:39）	and by this one everyone who believes is justified from everything from which the law of Moses could not justify you.
179	（Rom 10:4）	For Christ is the end of the law, with the result that there is righteousness for everyone who believes.
180	（Rom 1:16）	For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is God’s power for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
181	（John 12:44）	But Jesus shouted out, “The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me,
182	（John 11:26）	and the one who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
183	（John 1:12）	But to all who have received him – those who believe in his name – he has given the right to become God’s children
184	（John 3:16）	For this is the way God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.
185	（Acts 16:31）	They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.”
186	（Rom 3:21-22）	But now apart from the law the righteousness of God (although it is attested by the law and the prophets) has been disclosed –namely, the righteousness of God through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction,
187	（Rom 4:5）	But to the one who does not work, but believes in the one who declares the ungodly righteous, his faith is credited as righteousness.
188	（Ps 34:22）	The Lord rescues his servants; all who take shelter in him escape punishment.
189	（Rom 10:11）	For the scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.”
190	（Rom 10:9）	because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
191	（1Cor 1:21）	For since in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased to save those who believe by the foolishness of preaching.
192	（2Tim 1:12）	Because of this, in fact, I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, because I know the one in whom my faith is set and I am convinced that he is able to protect what has been entrusted to me until that day.
193	（Heb 3:14）	For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence firm until the end.
194	（1John 5:1）	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been fathered by God, and everyone who loves the father loves the child fathered by him.
195	（1John 5:13）	I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.
196	（John 6:35）	Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never go hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty.
197	（John 7:38-39）	let the one who believes in me drink. Just as the scripture says, ‘From within him will flow rivers of living water.’”(Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were going to receive, for the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.)
198	（John 14:12）	I tell you the solemn truth, the person who believes in me will perform the miraculous deeds that I am doing, and will perform greater deeds than these, because I am going to the Father.
199	（Eph 1:19）	and what is the incomparable greatness of his power toward us who believe, as displayed in the exercise of his immense strength.
200	（Heb 4:16）	Therefore let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help.
201	（Mark 11:24）	For this reason I tell you, whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
202	（1John 3:21-22）	Dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, we have confidence in the presence of God,and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing to him.
203	（1John 5:14）	And this is the confidence that we have before him: that whenever we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
204	（Matt 17:20）	He told them, “It was because of your little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; nothing will be impossible for you.”
205	（Heb 11:6）	Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
206	（Mark 9:23）	Then Jesus said to him, “‘If you are able?’ All things are possible for the one who believes.”
207	（Ps 37:5-6）	Commit your future to the Lord! Trust in him, and he will act on your behalf.He will vindicate you in broad daylight, and publicly defend your just cause.
208	（Ps 125:1）	A song of ascents. Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved and will endure forever.
209	（Isa 30:15）	For this is what the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One of Israel says: “If you repented and patiently waited for me, you would be delivered; if you calmly trusted in me you would find strength, but you are unwilling.
210	（Prov 3:5-6）	Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding.Acknowledge him in all your ways, and he will make your paths straight.
211	（John 12:46）	I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness.
212	（John 16:27）	For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.
213	（1John 5:5）	Now who is the person who has conquered the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
214	（Ps 31:19）	How great is your favor, which you store up for your loyal followers! In plain sight of everyone you bestow it on those who take shelter in you.
215	（Eph 6:16）	and in all of this, by taking up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
216	（Prov 3:26）	for the Lord will be the source of your confidence, and he will guard your foot from being caught in a trap.
217	（Ps 37:40）	The Lord helps them and rescues them; he rescues them from evil men and delivers them, for they seek his protection.
218	（Ps 18:30）	The one true God acts in a faithful manner; the Lord’s promise is reliable; he is a shield to all who take shelter in him.
219	（1Pet 1:5）	who by God’s power are protected through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
220	（Ps 5:11）	But may all who take shelter in you be happy! May they continually shout for joy! Shelter them so that those who are loyal to you may rejoice!
221	1.2.{4}	Prayers for Faith
222	（Luke 17:5）	The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”
223	（Mark 9:24）	Immediately the father of the boy cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!”
224	（Luke 22:32）	but I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. When you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”
225	1.2.{5}	Faith Affirmations
226	（Acts 15:11）	On the contrary, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they are.”
227	（1Kgs 8:23-24）	He prayed: “O Lord, God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven above or on earth below! You maintain covenantal loyalty to your servants who obey you with sincerity.You have kept your word to your servant, my father David; this very day you have fulfilled what you promised.
228	（Ps 31:14）	But I trust in you, O Lord! I declare, “You are my God!”
229	（Isa 25:1）	O Lord, you are my God! I will exalt you in praise, I will extol your fame. For you have done extraordinary things, and executed plans made long ago exactly as you decreed.
230	（Ps 33:21）	For our hearts rejoice in him, for we trust in his holy name.
231	（Ps 55:23）	But you, O God, will bring them down to the deep Pit. Violent and deceitful people will not live even half a normal lifespan. But as for me, I trust in you.
232	（Ps 26:1）	By David. Vindicate me, O Lord, for I have integrity, and I trust in the Lord without wavering.
233	（Ps 31:5）	Into your hand I entrust my life; you will rescue me, O Lord, the faithful God.
234	（Luke 1:38）	So Mary said, “Yes, I am a servant of the Lord; let this happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.
235	（Ps 89:1）	A well-written song by Ethan the Ezrachite. I will sing continually about the Lord’s faithful deeds; to future generations I will proclaim your faithfulness.
236	2.0	Using Scripture to Praise God
237	2.1.0	Beholding the Glory of Christ
238	（2Cor 3:18）	And we all, with unveiled faces reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, which is from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
239	（Isa 33:17）	You will see a king in his splendor; you will see a wide land.
240	（Heb 1:3）	The Son is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, and he sustains all things by his powerful word, and so when he had accomplished cleansing for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
241	（Job 16:19）	Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.
242	（Ps 45:7）	You love justice and hate evil. For this reason God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy, elevating you above your companions.
243	（Ps 89:27-29）	I will appoint him to be my firstborn son, the most exalted of the earth’s kings.I will always extend my loyal love to him, and my covenant with him is secure.I will give him an eternal dynasty, and make his throne as enduring as the skies above.
244	（Ps 110:1-2）	A psalm of David. Here is the Lord’s proclamation to my lord: “Sit down at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool!”The Lord extends your dominion from Zion. Rule in the midst of your enemies!
245	（Ps 132:17-18）	There I will make David strong; I have determined that my chosen king’s dynasty will continue.I will humiliate his enemies, and his crown will shine.
246	（Isa 9:6-7）	For a child has been born to us, a son has been given to us. He shoulders responsibility and is called: Amazing Adviser, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.His dominion will be vast and he will bring immeasurable prosperity. He will rule on David’s throne and over David’s kingdom, establishing it and strengthening it by promoting justice and fairness, from this time forward and forevermore. The zeal of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies will accomplish this.
247	（Isa 11:2-4）	The Lord’s Spirit will rest on him – a Spirit that gives extraordinary wisdom, a Spirit that provides the ability to execute plans, a Spirit that produces absolute loyalty to the Lord.He will take delight in obeying the Lord. He will not judge by mere appearances, or make decisions on the basis of hearsay.He will treat the poor fairly, and make right decisions for the downtrodden of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and order the wicked to be executed.
248	（Isa 11:10-11）	At that time a root from Jesse will stand like a signal flag for the nations. Nations will look to him for guidance, and his residence will be majestic.At that time the Lord will again lift his hand to reclaim the remnant of his people from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the seacoasts.
249	（Isa 22:22）	I will place the key to the house of David on his shoulder. When he opens the door, no one can close it; when he closes the door, no one can open it.
250	（Isa 42:1-4）	“Here is my servant whom I support, my chosen one in whom I take pleasure. I have placed my Spirit on him; he will make just decrees for the nations.He will not cry out or shout; he will not publicize himself in the streets.A crushed reed he will not break, a dim wick he will not extinguish; he will faithfully make just decrees.He will not grow dim or be crushed before establishing justice on the earth; the coastlands will wait in anticipation for his decrees.”
251	（Isa 44:6）	This is what the Lord, Israel’s king, says, their protector, the Lord of Heaven’s Armies: “I am the first and I am the last, there is no God but me.
252	（Isa 42:6-7）	“I, the Lord, officially commission you; I take hold of your hand. I protect you and make you a covenant mediator for people, and a light to the nations,to open blind eyes, to release prisoners from dungeons, those who live in darkness from prisons.
253	（Isa 53:5）	He was wounded because of our rebellious deeds, crushed because of our sins; he endured punishment that made us well; because of his wounds we have been healed.
254	（Isa 53:10-11）	Though the Lord desired to crush him and make him ill, once restitution is made, he will see descendants and enjoy long life, and the Lord’s purpose will be accomplished through him.Having suffered, he will reflect on his work, he will be satisfied when he understands what he has done. “My servant will acquit many, for he carried their sins.
255	（Isa 55:5）	Look, you will summon nations you did not previously know; nations that did not previously know you will run to you, because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he bestows honor on you.
256	（Isa 61:1-2）	The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon me, because the Lord has chosen me. He has commissioned me to encourage the poor, to help the brokenhearted, to decree the release of captives, and the freeing of prisoners,to announce the year when the Lord will show his favor, the day when our God will seek vengeance, to console all who mourn,
257	（Heb 4:14-16）	Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin.Therefore let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help.
258	（Jer 23:6）	Under his rule Judah will enjoy safety and Israel will live in security. This is the name he will go by: ‘The Lord has provided us with justice.’
259	（Jer 33:22）	I will make the children who follow one another in the line of my servant David very numerous. I will also make the Levites who minister before me very numerous. I will make them all as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sands which are on the seashore.’”
260	（Ezek 1:26）	Above the platform over their heads was something like a sapphire shaped like a throne. High above on the throne was a form that appeared to be a man.
261	（Ezek 1:28）	like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds after the rain. This was the appearance of the surrounding brilliant light; it looked like the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I threw myself face down, and I heard a voice speaking.
262	（Ezek 34:23）	I will set one shepherd over them, and he will feed them – namely, my servant David. He will feed them and will be their shepherd.
263	（Ezek 37:24）	“‘My servant David will be king over them; there will be one shepherd for all of them. They will follow my regulations and carefully observe my statutes.
264	（Hos 3:5）	Afterward, the Israelites will turn and seek the Lord their God and their Davidic king. Then they will submit to the Lord in fear and receive his blessings in the future.
265	（Dan 7:13-14）	I was watching in the night visions, “And with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man was approaching. He went up to the Ancient of Days and was escorted before him.To him was given ruling authority, honor, and sovereignty. All peoples, nations, and language groups were serving him. His authority is eternal and will not pass away. His kingdom will not be destroyed.
266	（Mic 5:2）	(5:1) As for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, seemingly insignificant among the clans of Judah – from you a king will emerge who will rule over Israel on my behalf, one whose origins are in the distant past.
267	（Mic 5:4-5）	He will assume his post and shepherd the people by the Lord’s strength, by the sovereign authority of the Lord his God. They will live securely, for at that time he will be honored even in the distant regions of the earth.He will give us peace. Should the Assyrians try to invade our land and attempt to set foot in our fortresses, we will send against them seven shepherd-rulers, make that eight commanders.
268	（Zech 12:10）	“I will pour out on the kingship of David and the population of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication so that they will look to me, the one they have pierced. They will lament for him as one laments for an only son, and there will be a bitter cry for him like the bitter cry for a firstborn.
269	（Jas 2:1）	My brothers and sisters, do not show prejudice if you possess faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.
270	（Col 3:4）	When Christ (who is your life) appears, then you too will be revealed in glory with him.
271	（Mark 10:45）	For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
272	（Luke 1:32）	He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.
273	（Luke 19:10）	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”
274	（Luke 22:69）	But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”
275	（John 1:14）	Now the Word became flesh and took up residence among us. We saw his glory – the glory of the one and only, full of grace and truth, who came from the Father.
276	（John 5:19）	So Jesus answered them, “I tell you the solemn truth, the Son can do nothing on his own initiative, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.
277	（John 10:11）	“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
278	（John 10:14-15）	“I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me –just as the Father knows me and I know the Father – and I lay down my life for the sheep.
279	（Acts 2:23）	this man, who was handed over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you executed by nailing him to a cross at the hands of Gentiles.
280	（Acts 4:12）	And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among people by which we must be saved.”
281	（Acts 10:38）	with respect to Jesus from Nazareth, that God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him.
282	（Gal 1:3-4）	Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father,
283	（Phil 2:9-11）	As a result God highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name,so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow – in heaven and on earth and under the earth –and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
284	（Col 2:2-3）	My goal is that their hearts, having been knit together in love, may be encouraged, and that they may have all the riches that assurance brings in their understanding of the knowledge of the mystery of God, namely, Christ,in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
285	（Titus 2:13-14）	as we wait for the happy fulfillment of our hope in the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.He gave himself for us to set us free from every kind of lawlessness and to purify for himself a people who are truly his, who are eager to do good.
286	（Heb 1:8）	but of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and a righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom.
287	（Heb 2:10）	For it was fitting for him, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
288	（Heb 2:16-18）	For surely his concern is not for angels, but he is concerned for Abraham’s descendants.Therefore he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.For since he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
289	（Heb 4:14-15）	Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin.
290	（Heb 5:7-9）	During his earthly life Christ offered both requests and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his devotion.Although he was a son, he learned obedience through the things he suffered.And by being perfected in this way, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him,
291	（Heb 7:16）	who has become a priest not by a legal regulation about physical descent but by the power of an indestructible life.
292	（Heb 7:25）	So he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.
293	（Heb 9:14）	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our consciences from dead works to worship the living God.
294	（Heb 10:12-13）	But when this priest had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, he sat down at the right hand of God,where he is now waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.
295	（1John 2:2）	and he himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world.
296	（Rev 1:5）	and from Jesus Christ – the faithful witness, the firstborn from among the dead, the ruler over the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and has set us free from our sins at the cost of his own blood
297	（Rev 1:16）	He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp double-edged sword extended out of his mouth. His face shone like the sun shining at full strength.
298	（Rev 1:18）	and the one who lives! I was dead, but look, now I am alive – forever and ever – and I hold the keys of death and of Hades!
299	（Rev 5:4-7）	So I began weeping bitterly because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop weeping! Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered; thus he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”Then I saw standing in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb that appeared to have been killed. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.Then he came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne,
300	（Rev 5:9）	They were singing a new song: “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals because you were killed, and at the cost of your own blood you have purchased for God persons from every tribe, language, people, and nation.
301	（Rev 5:12-13）	all of whom were singing in a loud voice: “Worthy is the lamb who was killed to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and praise!”Then I heard every creature – in heaven, on earth, under the earth, in the sea, and all that is in them – singing: “To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb be praise, honor, glory, and ruling power forever and ever!”
302	（Rev 19:16）	He has a name written on his clothing and on his thigh: “King of kings and Lord of lords.”
303	（Rev 21:22-23）	Now I saw no temple in the city, because the Lord God – the All-Powerful – and the Lamb are its temple.The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because the glory of God lights it up, and its lamp is the Lamb.
304	2.2.0	Beholding the Greatness of God
305	（Rom 1:20）	For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes – his eternal power and divine nature – have been clearly seen, because they are understood through what has been made. So people are without excuse.
306	（1Cor 8:6）	yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we live, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we live.
307	（Dan 7:9-10）	“While I was watching, thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His attire was white like snow; the hair of his head was like lamb’s wool. His throne was ablaze with fire and its wheels were all aflame.A river of fire was streaming forth and proceeding from his presence. Many thousands were ministering to him; many tens of thousands stood ready to serve him. The court convened and the books were opened.
308	（Dan 4:17）	This announcement is by the decree of the sentinels; this decision is by the pronouncement of the holy ones, so that those who are alive may understand that the Most High has authority over human kingdoms, and he bestows them on whomever he wishes. He establishes over them even the lowliest of human beings.’
309	（Dan 4:35）	All the inhabitants of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he wishes with the army of heaven and with those who inhabit the earth. No one slaps his hand and says to him, ‘What have you done?’
310	（Rom 11:32-36）	For God has consigned all people to disobedience so that he may show mercy to them all.Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how unfathomable his ways!For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?Or who has first given to God, that God needs to repay him?For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever! Amen.

592	（Ps 107:20）	He sent them an assuring word and healed them; he rescued them from the pits where they were trapped.

596	（Jer 50:4-5）	“When that time comes,” says the Lord, “the people of Israel and Judah will return to the land together.

597	（Ezek 11:19-20）	I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within them; I will remove the hearts of stone from their bodies and I will give them tender hearts,so that they may follow my statutes and observe my regulations and carry them out.

598	（Ezek 18:23）	Do I actually delight in the death of the wicked, declares the Sovereign Lord? Do I not prefer that he turn from his wicked conduct and live?

600	（Hos 2:19-20）	I will commit myself to you forever; I will commit myself to you in righteousness and justice, in steadfast love and tender compassion.I will commit myself to you in faithfulness; then you will acknowledge the Lord.”
601	（Joel 2:32）	It will so happen that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be delivered. For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who survive, just as the Lord has promised; the remnant will be those whom the Lord will call.
602	（Luke 5:32）	I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
603	（Luke 19:10）	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”
604	（John 5:24-25）	“I tell you the solemn truth, the one who hears my message and believes the one who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned, but has crossed over from death to life.I tell you the solemn truth, a time is coming – and is now here – when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
605	（John 6:37）	Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never send away.

608	（John 11:25-26）	Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live even if he dies,and the one who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
609	（John 14:6）	Jesus replied, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
610	（John 20:31）	But these are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
611	（Acts 2:38-39）	Peter said to them, “Repent, and each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.For the promise is for you and your children, and for all who are far away, as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.”
612	（Acts 3:19-20）	Therefore repent and turn back so that your sins may be wiped out,so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and so that he may send the Messiah appointed for you – that is, Jesus.
613	（Acts 11:18）	When they heard this, they ceased their objections and praised God, saying, “So then, God has granted the repentance that leads to life even to the Gentiles.”
614	（Acts 13:38）	Therefore let it be known to you, brothers, that through this one forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,
615	（Acts 16:31）	They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.”
616	（Acts 26:18）	to open their eyes so that they turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’
617	（Rom 1:16）	For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is God’s power for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
618	（Rom 4:5）	But to the one who does not work, but believes in the one who declares the ungodly righteous, his faith is credited as righteousness.
619	（Rom 5:1）	Therefore, since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
620	（Rom 5:8）	But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
621	（Rom 8:1）	There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
622	（Rom 9:16）	So then, it does not depend on human desire or exertion, but on God who shows mercy.
623	（Rom 10:4）	For Christ is the end of the law, with the result that there is righteousness for everyone who believes.
624	（Rom 10:9）	because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
625	（Rom 10:12-13）	For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, who richly blesses all who call on him.For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
626	（Rom 10:17）	Consequently faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the preached word of Christ.
627	（1Cor 1:18）	For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
628	（1Cor 15:22）	For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
629	（1Cor 15:49）	And just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, let us also bear the image of the man of heaven.
630	（2Cor 5:19）	In other words, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting people’s trespasses against them, and he has given us the message of reconciliation.
631	（2Cor 5:21）	God made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we would become the righteousness of God.
632	（1Thess 5:9）	For God did not destine us for wrath but for gaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
633	（Eph 2:8-9）	For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God;it is not from works, so that no one can boast.

800	（Rom 9:24-26）	even us, whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?As he also says in Hosea: “I will call those who were not my people, ‘My people,’ and I will call her who was unloved, ‘My beloved.’”“And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”
801	（Mic 4:1-2）	In the future the Lord’s Temple Mount will be the most important mountain of all; it will be more prominent than other hills. People will stream to it.Many nations will come, saying, “Come on! Let’s go up to the Lord’s mountain, to the temple of Jacob’s God, so he can teach us his ways and we can live by his laws.” For instruction will proceed from Zion, the Lord’s message from Jerusalem.
802	（Mic 7:15）	“As in the days when you departed from the land of Egypt, I will show you miraculous deeds.”
803	（Zeph 3:11-12）	In that day you will not be ashamed of all your rebelliousness against me, for then I will remove from your midst those who proudly boast, and you will never again be arrogant on my holy hill.I will leave in your midst a humble and meek group of people, and they will find safety in the Lord’s presence.
804	（Zeph 3:19-20）	Look, at that time I will deal with those who mistreated you. I will rescue the lame sheep and gather together the scattered sheep. I will take away their humiliation and make the whole earth admire and respect them.At that time I will lead you – at the time I gather you together. Be sure of this! I will make all the nations of the earth respect and admire you when you see me restore you,” says the Lord.

807	（Zech 2:10-11）	“Sing out and be happy, Zion my daughter! For look, I have come; I will settle in your midst,” says the Lord.“Many nations will join themselves to the Lord on the day of salvation, and they will also be my people.

812	（Matt 21:13）	And he said to them, “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you are turning it into a den of robbers!”
813	（Matt 25:34）	Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

821	（John 17:26）	I made known your name to them, and I will continue to make it known, so that the love you have loved me with may be in them, and I may be in them.”
822	（Acts 20:28）	Watch out for yourselves and for all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God that he obtained with the blood of his own Son.
823	（1Cor 2:16）	For who has known the mind of the Lord, so as to advise him? But we have the mind of Christ.
824	（1Cor 3:21-23）	So then, no more boasting about mere mortals! For everything belongs to you,whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future. Everything belongs to you,and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
825	（1Cor 12:18）	But as a matter of fact, God has placed each of the members in the body just as he decided.
826	（1Cor 12:24-26）	but our presentable members do not need this. Instead, God has blended together the body, giving greater honor to the lesser member,so that there may be no division in the body, but the members may have mutual concern for one another.If one member suffers, everyone suffers with it. If a member is honored, all rejoice with it.
827	（2Cor 2:14）	But thanks be to God who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and who makes known through us the fragrance that consists of the knowledge of him in every place.
828	（Gal 3:26-27）	For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith.For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
829	（Gal 3:29）	And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants, heirs according to the promise.
830	（Eph 2:6）	and he raised us up together with him and seated us together with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,
831	（Eph 2:22）	in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.
832	（Eph 3:10）	The purpose of this enlightenment is that through the church the multifaceted wisdom of God should now be disclosed to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms.
833	（Eph 3:20-21）	Now to him who by the power that is working within us is able to do far beyond all that we ask or think,to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
834	（Eph 4:11-12）	And he himself gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,to equip the saints for the work of ministry, that is, to build up the body of Christ,
835	（Col 2:19）	He has not held fast to the head from whom the whole body, supported and knit together through its ligaments and sinews, grows with a growth that is from God.
836	（Col 3:3）	for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
837	（1Thess 5:5）	For you all are sons of the light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of the darkness.
838	（Heb 2:11）	For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have the same origin, and so he is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,
839	（Heb 11:16）	But as it is, they aspire to a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
840	（1Pet 2:5）	you yourselves, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood and to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
841	（1Pet 2:9）	But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people of his own, so that you may proclaim the virtues of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
842	（1John 1:7）	But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
843	（1John 2:1）	(My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin.) But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous One,
844	（1John 3:2-3）	Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever it is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is.And everyone who has this hope focused on him purifies himself, just as Jesus is pure).
845	（Jude 1:1）	From Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who are called, wrapped in the love of God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ.
846	（Rev 7:15）	For this reason they are before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple, and the one seated on the throne will shelter them.
847	（Rev 7:17）	because the Lamb in the middle of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
848	（Rev 21:3-4）	And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: “Look! The residence of God is among human beings. He will live among them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them.He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death will not exist any more – or mourning, or crying, or pain, for the former things have ceased to exist.”
849	（Rev 22:3-5）	And there will no longer be any curse, and the throne of God and the Lamb will be in the city. His servants will worship him,and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.Night will be no more, and they will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will shine on them, and they will reign forever and ever.

902	（2Pet 1:20-21）	Above all, you do well if you recognize this: No prophecy of scripture ever comes about by the prophet’s own imagination,for no prophecy was ever borne of human impulse; rather, men carried along by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.

943	（Isa 10:20-21）	At that time those left in Israel, those who remain of the family of Jacob, will no longer rely on a foreign leader that abuses them. Instead they will truly rely on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.A remnant will come back, a remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
944	（Isa 27:6）	The time is coming when Jacob will take root; Israel will blossom and grow branches. The produce will fill the surface of the world.
945	（Isa 29:17-19）	In just a very short time Lebanon will turn into an orchard, and the orchard will be considered a forest.At that time the deaf will be able to hear words read from a scroll, and the eyes of the blind will be able to see through deep darkness.The downtrodden will again rejoice in the Lord; the poor among humankind will take delight in the Holy One of Israel.
946	（Isa 29:22）	So this is what the Lord, the one who delivered Abraham, has said to the family of Jacob: “Jacob will no longer be ashamed; their faces will no longer show their embarrassment.

949	（Isa 35:1-2）	Let the wilderness and desert be happy; let the arid rift valley rejoice and bloom like a lily!Let it richly bloom; let it rejoice and shout with delight! It is given the grandeur of Lebanon, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the grandeur of the Lord, the splendor of our God.
950	（Isa 35:6）	Then the lame will leap like a deer, the mute tongue will shout for joy; for water will burst forth in the wilderness, streams in the arid rift valley.
951	（Isa 41:18）	I will make streams flow down the slopes and produce springs in the middle of the valleys. I will turn the wilderness into a pool of water and the arid land into springs.
952	（Isa 43:20-21）	The wild animals honor me, the jackals and ostriches, because I put water in the wilderness and streams in the wastelands, to quench the thirst of my chosen people,the people whom I formed for myself, so they might praise me.”
953	（Isa 44:3-5）	For I will pour water on the parched ground and cause streams to flow on the dry land. I will pour my Spirit on your offspring and my blessing on your children.They will sprout up like a tree in the grass, like poplars beside channels of water.One will say, ‘I belong to the Lord,’ and another will use the name ‘Jacob.’ One will write on his hand, ‘The Lord’s,’ and use the name ‘Israel.’”
954	（Isa 51:3）	Certainly the Lord will console Zion; he will console all her ruins. He will make her wilderness like Eden, her arid rift valley like the Garden of the Lord. Happiness and joy will be restored to her, thanksgiving and the sound of music.
955	（Isa 54:13）	All your children will be followers of the Lord, and your children will enjoy great prosperity.
956	（Jer 3:12）	“Go and shout this message to my people in the countries in the north. Tell them, ‘Come back to me, wayward Israel,’ says the Lord. ‘I will not continue to look on you with displeasure. For I am merciful,’ says the Lord. ‘I will not be angry with you forever.
957	（Jer 24:7）	I will give them the desire to acknowledge that I am the Lord. I will be their God and they will be my people. For they will wholeheartedly return to me.’
958	（Jer 30:17）	Yes, I will restore you to health. I will heal your wounds. I, the Lord, affirm it! For you have been called an outcast, Zion, whom no one cares for.”
959	（Jer 30:19）	Out of those places you will hear songs of thanksgiving and the sounds of laughter and merriment. I will increase their number and they will not dwindle away. I will bring them honor and they will no longer be despised.
960	（Jer 31:9）	They will come back shedding tears of contrition. I will bring them back praying prayers of repentance. I will lead them besides streams of water, along smooth paths where they will never stumble. I will do this because I am Israel’s father; Ephraim is my firstborn son.’”
961	（Hos 6:1-3）	“Come on! Let’s return to the Lord! He himself has torn us to pieces, but he will heal us! He has injured us, but he will bandage our wounds!He will restore us in a very short time; he will heal us in a little while, so that we may live in his presence.So let us search for him! Let us seek to know the Lord! He will come to our rescue as certainly as the appearance of the dawn, as certainly as the winter rain comes, as certainly as the spring rain that waters the land.”
962	（Joel 2:25）	I will make up for the years that the ‘arbeh-locust consumed your crops – the yeleq-locust, the hasil-locust, and the gazam-locust – my great army that I sent against you.

988	（Ezek 39:29）	I will no longer hide my face from them, when I pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
989	（Joel 2:28-29）	(3:1) After all of this I will pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your elderly will have prophetic dreams; your young men will see visions.Even on male and female servants I will pour out my Spirit in those days.
990	（Matt 3:11）	“I baptize you with water, for repentance, but the one coming after me is more powerful than I am – I am not worthy to carry his sandals! He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
991	（Luke 11:13）	If you then, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”
992	（Luke 24:49）	And look, I am sending you what my Father promised. But stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”
993	（John 7:37-39）	On the last day of the feast, the greatest day, Jesus stood up and shouted out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, andlet the one who believes in me drink. Just as the scripture says, ‘From within him will flow rivers of living water.’”(Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were going to receive, for the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.)
994	（John 14:12）	I tell you the solemn truth, the person who believes in me will perform the miraculous deeds that I am doing, and will perform greater deeds than these, because I am going to the Father.
995	（John 14:16-17）	Then I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you forever –the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept, because it does not see him or know him. But you know him, because he resides with you and will be in you.
996	（John 14:26-27）	But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and will cause you to remember everything I said to you.“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you; I do not give it to you as the world does. Do not let your hearts be distressed or lacking in courage.
997	（John 16:13-14）	But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. For he will not speak on his own authority, but will speak whatever he hears, and will tell you what is to come.He will glorify me, because he will receive from me what is mine and will tell it to you.
998	（John 20:22）	And after he said this, he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.
999	（Acts 1:8）	But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the farthest parts of the earth.”
1000	（Rom 5:5）	And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
1001	（Rom 7:6）	But now we have been released from the law, because we have died to what controlled us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit and not under the old written code.
1002	（Rom 8:13）	(for if you live according to the flesh, you will die), but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live.
1003	（Rom 8:14-15）	For all who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.For you did not receive the spirit of slavery leading again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, “Abba, Father.”
1004	（Gal 4:6）	And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls “Abba! Father!”
1005	（Rom 8:16）	The Spirit himself bears witness to our spirit that we are God’s children.
1006	（1Cor 2:9-10）	But just as it is written, “Things that no eye has seen, or ear heard, or mind imagined, are the things God has prepared for those who love him.”God has revealed these to us by the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
1007	（1Cor 2:12）	Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God.
1008	（1Cor 12:11）	It is one and the same Spirit, distributing as he decides to each person, who produces all these things.
1009	（2Cor 3:6）	who made us adequate to be servants of a new covenant not based on the letter but on the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
1010	（2Cor 3:17-18）	Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is present, there is freedom.And we all, with unveiled faces reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, which is from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
1011	（Gal 5:16）	But I say, live by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the flesh.
1012	（Gal 5:18）	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
1013	（Gal 5:22-23）	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
1014	（Gal 6:8）	because the person who sows to his own flesh will reap corruption from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.
1015	（1John 2:20）	Nevertheless you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.
1016	（1John 2:27）	Now as for you, the anointing that you received from him resides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things, it is true and is not a lie. Just as it has taught you, you reside in him.

1889	（Rev 1:17-18）	When I saw him I fell down at his feet as though I were dead, but he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid! I am the first and the last,and the one who lives! I was dead, but look, now I am alive – forever and ever – and I hold the keys of death and of Hades!
1890	（Rev 21:4）	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death will not exist any more – or mourning, or crying, or pain, for the former things have ceased to exist.”

1951	6.1.0	Praying with Faith
1952	（Mark 9:22-24）	It has often thrown him into fire or water to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”Then Jesus said to him, “‘If you are able?’ All things are possible for the one who believes.”Immediately the father of the boy cried out and said, “I believe; help my unbelief!”
1953	（Mark 9:28-29）	Then, after he went into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”He told them, “This kind can come out only by prayer.”
1954	（Luke 8:45）	Then Jesus asked, “Who was it who touched me?” When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are surrounding you and pressing against you!”
1955	（Luke 8:46）	But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, for I know that power has gone out from me.”
1956	（Luke 8:48）	Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
1957	（Mark 6:5-6）	He was not able to do a miracle there, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.And he was amazed because of their unbelief. Then he went around among the villages and taught.
1958	6.1.1	The person of Christ generates faith.
1959	（Luke 7:12-15）	As he approached the town gate, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother (who was a widow), and a large crowd from the town was with her.When the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, “Do not weep.”Then he came up and touched the bier, and those who carried it stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”So the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
1960	（Mark 2:4-11）	When they were not able to bring him in because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Jesus. Then, after tearing it out, they lowered the stretcher the paralytic was lying on.When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”Now some of the experts in the law were sitting there, turning these things over in their minds:“Why does this man speak this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”Now immediately, when Jesus realized in his spirit that they were contemplating such thoughts, he said to them, “Why are you thinking such things in your hearts?Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up, take your stretcher, and walk’?But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” – he said to the paralytic –“I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher, and go home.”
1961	（Matt 8:2-3）	And a leper approached and bowed low before him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”He stretched out his hand and touched him saying, “I am willing. Be clean!” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
1962	（Matt 15:22-28）	A Canaanite woman from that area came and cried out, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is horribly demon-possessed!”But he did not answer her a word. Then his disciples came and begged him, “Send her away, because she keeps on crying out after us.”So he answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”But she came and bowed down before him and said, “Lord, help me!”“It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs,” he said.“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, your faith is great! Let what you want be done for you.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.
1963	6.1.2	The cross of Christ generates faith.
1964	（Rom 10:17）	Consequently faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the preached word of Christ.
1965	（Rom 8:31-32）	What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all – how will he not also, along with him, freely give us all things?
1966	6.1.3	The promises of Scripture generate faith
1967	（Heb 11:6）	Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
1968	（Rom 4:19-21）	Without being weak in faith, he considered his own body as dead (because he was about one hundred years old) and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.He did not waver in unbelief about the promise of God but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God.He was fully convinced that what God promised he was also able to do.
1969	（Heb 11:26）	He regarded abuse suffered for Christ to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for his eyes were fixed on the reward.
1970	（Ps 9:10）	Your loyal followers trust in you, for you, Lord, do not abandon those who seek your help.
1971	6.2.0	Faith and the Prayerful Use of Promises
1972	（2Sam 7:21）	For the sake of your promise and according to your purpose you have done this great thing in order to reveal it to your servant.
1973	（2Cor 6:16-7:1）	And what mutual agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said, “I will live in them and will walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”Therefore “come out from their midst, and be separate,” says the Lord, “and touch no unclean thing, and I will welcome you,and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,” says the All-Powerful Lord.Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that could defile the body and the spirit, and thus accomplish holiness out of reverence for God.
1974	（2Pet 1:3-4）	I can pray this because his divine power has bestowed on us everything necessary for life and godliness through the rich knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence.Through these things he has bestowed on us his precious and most magnificent promises, so that by means of what was promised you may become partakers of the divine nature, after escaping the worldly corruption that is produced by evil desire.
1975	（Eph 3:6）	namely, that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.
1976	（2Cor 1:19-20）	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the one who was proclaimed among you by us – by me and Silvanus and Timothy – was not “Yes” and “No,” but it has always been “Yes” in him.For every one of God’s promises are “Yes” in him; therefore also through him the “Amen” is spoken, to the glory we give to God.
1977	（Rom 4:16）	For this reason it is by faith so that it may be by grace, with the result that the promise may be certain to all the descendants – not only to those who are under the law, but also to those who have the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all
1978	（Gal 3:16）	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. Scripture does not say, “and to the descendants,” referring to many, but “and to your descendant,” referring to one, who is Christ.
1979	（Jer 33:14-16）	“I, the Lord, affirm: ‘The time will certainly come when I will fulfill my gracious promise concerning the nations of Israel and Judah.In those days and at that time I will raise up for them a righteous descendant of David. “‘He will do what is just and right in the land.Under his rule Judah will enjoy safety and Jerusalem will live in security. At that time Jerusalem will be called “The Lord has provided us with justice.”
1980	（Ezek 12:28）	Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: None of my words will be delayed any longer! The word I speak will come to pass, declares the Sovereign Lord.’”
1981	（Acts 7:17）	“But as the time drew near for God to fulfill the promise he had declared to Abraham, the people increased greatly in number in Egypt,
1982	（Heb 6:12）	so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherit the promises.
1983	（Heb 6:15）	And so by persevering, Abraham inherited the promise.
1984	（Heb 10:35-36）	So do not throw away your confidence, because it has great reward.For you need endurance in order to do God’s will and so receive what is promised.
1985	（Heb 11:33）	Through faith they conquered kingdoms, administered justice, gained what was promised, shut the mouths of lions,
1986	（Gen 31:3）	The Lord said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives. I will be with you.”
1987	（Gen 32:9）	Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O Lord, you said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives and I will make you prosper.’
1988	（Gen 32:12）	But you said, ‘I will certainly make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand on the seashore, too numerous to count.’”
1989	（Exod 32:11-13）	But Moses sought the favor of the Lord his God and said, “O Lord, why does your anger burn against your people, whom you have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?Why should the Egyptians say, ‘For evil he led them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your burning anger, and relent of this evil against your people.Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel your servants, to whom you swore by yourself and told them, ‘I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken about I will give to your descendants, and they will inherit it forever.’”
1990	（Ps 77:7-10）	I asked, “Will the Lord reject me forever? Will he never again show me his favor?Has his loyal love disappeared forever? Has his promise failed forever?Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has his anger stifled his compassion?” (Selah)Then I said, “I am sickened by the thought that the Most High might become inactive.
1991	（2Sam 7:20-21）	What more can David say to you? You have given your servant special recognition, O Sovereign Lord!For the sake of your promise and according to your purpose you have done this great thing in order to reveal it to your servant.
1992	（2Sam 7:25）	So now, O Lord God, make this promise you have made about your servant and his family a permanent reality. Do as you promised,
1993	（2Sam 7:28-29）	Now, O Sovereign Lord, you are the true God! May your words prove to be true! You have made this good promise to your servant!Now be willing to bless your servant’s dynasty so that it may stand permanently before you, for you, O Sovereign Lord, have spoken. By your blessing may your servant’s dynasty be blessed on into the future!”
1994	（Dan 9:2-3）	in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, came to understand from the sacred books that the number of years for the fulfilling of the desolation of Jerusalem, which had come as the Lord’s message to the prophet Jeremiah, would be 70 years.So I turned my attention to the Lord God to implore him by prayer and requests, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
1995	（Neh 1:8-9）	Please recall the word you commanded your servant Moses: ‘If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the nations.But if you repent and obey my commandments and do them, then even if your dispersed people are in the most remote location, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen for my name to reside.’
1996	（Ps 119:49）	Remember your word to your servant, for you have given me hope.
1997	（Ps 119:58）	I seek your favor with all my heart. Have mercy on me as you promised!
1998	（Ps 119:38）	Confirm to your servant your promise, which you made to the one who honors you.
1999	（Ps 119:41）	May I experience your loyal love, O Lord, and your deliverance, as you promised.
2000	（Ps 119:76）	May your loyal love console me, as you promised your servant.
2001	（Ps 119:116）	Sustain me as you promised, so that I will live. Do not disappoint me!
2002	（Ps 119:132-133）	Turn toward me and extend mercy to me, as you typically do to your loyal followers.Direct my steps by your word! Do not let any sin dominate me!
2003	（Ps 119:154）	Fight for me and defend me! Revive me with your word!
2004	（Num 14:17）	So now, let the power of my Lord be great, just as you have said,
2005	（Neh 9:8）	When you perceived that his heart was faithful toward you, you established a covenant with him to give his descendants the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites. You have fulfilled your promise, for you are righteous.
2006	（1Kgs 8:56）	“The Lord is worthy of praise because he has made Israel his people secure just as he promised! Not one of all the faithful promises he made through his servant Moses is left unfulfilled!
2007	（Jer 32:24）	Even now siege ramps have been built up around the city in order to capture it. War, starvation, and disease are sure to make the city fall into the hands of the Babylonians who are attacking it. Lord, you threatened that this would happen. Now you can see that it is already taking place.
2008	（Luke 1:38）	So Mary said, “Yes, I am a servant of the Lord; let this happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.
