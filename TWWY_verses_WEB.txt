24	0.5.0	Why Scripture Promises Are So Important for Our Prayers
25	（Gen 31:2）	Jacob saw the expression on Laban’s face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
26	（Gen 32:12）	You said, ‘I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can’t be counted because there are so many.’”
27	（Gen 32:9）	Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’
28	（2Cor 1:20）	For however many are the promises of God, in him is the “Yes.” Therefore also through him is the “Amen”, to the glory of God through us.
29	（2Cor 6:1）	Working together, we entreat also that you do not receive the grace of God in vain,
30	（2Cor 6:16）	What agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk in them. I will be their God and they will be my people.” [6:16 Leviticus 26:12 ; Jeremiah 32:38 ; Ezekiel 37:27 ]
31	（Lev 26:12）	I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will be my people.
32	（Exod 32:27）	He said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.’”
33	（Isa 52:11）	Depart! Depart! Go out from there! Touch no unclean thing! Go out from among her! Cleanse yourselves, you who carry Yahweh’s vessels.
34	（2Cor 7:1）	Having therefore these promises, beloved, let’s cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
35	（Gal 3:16）	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. [3:16 or, seed] He doesn’t say, “To descendants [3:16 or, seeds]”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”, [3:16 Genesis 12:7 ; 13:15 ; 24:7 ] which is Christ.
36	（Gal 3:29）	If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring and heirs according to promise.
37	0.6.0	Four Important Truths
38	0.6.1	Promises will only and always mean what they mean in their context and with the intent with which they were written.
39	（Matt 4:5-7）	Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and, ‘On their hands they will bear you up, so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’” [4:6 Psalm 91:11-12 ]Jesus said to him, “Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’” [4:7 Deuteronomy 6:16 ]
40	0.6.2	Promises sometimes have a multiple fulfillment in the past, present and future.
41	（Joel 2:29-32）	And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days, I will pour out my Spirit.I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, as Yahweh has said, and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.
42	（Acts 2:15）	For these aren’t drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only the third hour of the day. [2:15 about 9:00 a.m.]
43	（Rev 6:12）	I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood.
44	（Isa 7:10-16）	Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,“Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.”But Ahaz said, “I won’t ask. I won’t tempt Yahweh.”He said, “Listen now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God also?Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. [7:14 “Immanuel” means “God with us”.]He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken.
45	（Matt 1:21-23）	She shall give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus, [1:21 “Jesus” means “Salvation”.] for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall give birth to a son. They shall call his name Immanuel;” which is, being interpreted, “God with us.” [1:23 Isaiah 7:14 ]
46	0.6.3	Promises that are conditional always require fulfillment of the condition before the promise is granted.
47	（Ps 50:14-15）	Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving. Pay your vows to the Most High.Call on me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”
48	（Matt 6:33）	But seek first God’s Kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things will be given to you as well.
49	0.6.4	Promises that are granted are sometimes delayed for many years.
50	（Ps 69:13）	But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time. God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.
51	（Heb 6:15）	Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
52	0.7.0	Living Before the Face of God
53	（Ps 89:15-16）	Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you. They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.In your name they rejoice all day. In your righteousness, they are exalted.
54	（Gal 5:25）	If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.
55	0.7.{6}.1	Presenting Ourselves to God
56	（1Pet 2:23）	When he was cursed, he didn’t curse back. When he suffered, he didn’t threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously.
57	（1Pet 2:21）	For you were called to this, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you [2:21 TR reads “us” instead of “you”] an example, that you should follow his steps,
58	（1Pet 4:19）	Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator.
59	（Ps 31:5）	Into your hand I commend my spirit. You redeem me, Yahweh, God of truth.
60	（Luke 23:46）	Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last.

65	（Ps 62:5）	My soul, wait in silence for God alone, for my expectation is from him.
66	（Ps 141:8）	For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord. In you, I take refuge. Don’t leave my soul destitute.
67	（Ps 73:28）	But it is good for me to come close to God. I have made the Lord Yahweh [73:28 “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.] my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
68	（Ps 123:1-2）	A Song of Ascents. I lift up my eyes to you, you who sit in the heavens.Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God, until he has mercy on us.
69	（Col 3:23）	And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,
70	（Ps 37:5）	Commit your way to Yahweh. Trust also in him, and he will do this:
71	（Ps 26:1）	By David. Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.
72	（Ps 119:55）	I have remembered your name, Yahweh, in the night, and I obey your law.
73	（Ps 31:5）	Into your hand I commend my spirit. You redeem me, Yahweh, God of truth.
74	（Job 5:8）	“But as for me, I would seek God. I would commit my cause to God,
75	（Isa 26:8-9）	Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, we have waited for you. Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.With my soul I have desired you in the night. Yes, with my spirit within me I will seek you earnestly; for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
76	（Ps 39:7）	Now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in you.
77	（Ps 71:14）	But I will always hope, and will add to all of your praise.
78	（Rom 6:13）	Also, do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
79	（Rom 12:1）	Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.
80	（1Pet 2:23）	When he was cursed, he didn’t curse back. When he suffered, he didn’t threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously.
81	（1Pet 4:19）	Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator.
82	（Ps 90:1）	[BOOK 4] A Prayer by Moses, the man of God. [ 90:0 The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “אֱלֹהִ֑ים” (Elohim).] Lord, [90:1 The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”] you have been our dwelling place for all generations.

86	（Heb 10:5-7）	Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, “You didn’t desire sacrifice and offering, but you prepared a body for me.You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.’” [10:7 Psalm 40:6-8 ]
87	（Matt 26:39）	He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”
88	（Matt 26:42）	Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.”
89	（Phil 4:11-13）	Not that I speak because of lack, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it.I know how to be humbled, and I also know how to abound. In everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.
90	（Rom 8:28-29）	We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose.For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.

97	（Ps 77:19）	Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were not known.
98	（Jer 10:23）	Yahweh, I know that the way of man is not in himself. It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
99	（Eccl 5:19）	Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God.

159	（Ps 93:5）	Your statutes stand firm. Holiness adorns your house, Yahweh, forever more.
160	（Heb 6:17-19）	In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath,that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;
161	（1Thess 5:24）	He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.
162	（Heb 10:23）	let’s hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering; for he who promised is faithful.

167	（Isa 49:7）	Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, says to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers: “Kings shall see and rise up, princes, and they shall worship, because of Yahweh who is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”
168	（1Cor 1:9）	God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.
169	（2Thess 3:3）	But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one.

171	1.2.{3}	Promises to Those Who Trust God
172	（Ps 9:10）	Those who know your name will put their trust in you, for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.
173	（Jer 17:7-8）	“Blessed is the man who trusts in Yahweh, and whose confidence is in Yahweh.For he will be as a tree planted by the waters, who spreads out its roots by the river, and will not fear when heat comes, but its leaf will be green, and will not be concerned in the year of drought. It won’t cease from yielding fruit.
174	（Nah 1:7）	Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knows those who take refuge in him.
175	（Heb 10:35）	Therefore don’t throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.
176	（Matt 8:13）	Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have believed.” His servant was healed in that hour.
177	（Acts 10:43）	All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins.”
178	（Acts 13:39）	and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
179	（Rom 10:4）	For Christ is the fulfillment [10:4 or, completion, or end] of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
180	（Rom 1:16）	For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, because it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first, and also for the Greek.
181	（John 12:44）	Jesus cried out and said, “Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me.
182	（John 11:26）	Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
183	（John 1:12）	But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in his name:
184	（John 3:16）	For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
185	（Acts 16:31）	They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.”
186	（Rom 3:21-22）	But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no distinction,
187	（Rom 4:5）	But to him who doesn’t work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.
188	（Ps 34:22）	Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants. None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned.
189	（Rom 10:11）	For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.” [10:11 Isaiah 28:16 ]
190	（Rom 10:9）	that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
191	（1Cor 1:21）	For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn’t know God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.
192	（2Tim 1:12）	For this cause I also suffer these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.
193	（Heb 3:14）	For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm to the end,
194	（1John 5:1）	Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. Whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him.
195	（1John 5:13）	These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.
196	（John 6:35）	Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
197	（John 7:38-39）	He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.”But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified.
198	（John 14:12）	Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.
199	（Eph 1:19）	and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might
200	（Heb 4:16）	Let’s therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for help in time of need.
201	（Mark 11:24）	Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them.
202	（1John 3:21-22）	Beloved, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have boldness toward God;so whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
203	（1John 5:14）	This is the boldness which we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us.
204	（Matt 17:20）	He said to them, “Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.
205	（Heb 11:6）	Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.
206	（Mark 9:23）	Jesus said to him, “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.”
207	（Ps 37:5-6）	Commit your way to Yahweh. Trust also in him, and he will do this:he will make your righteousness shine out like light, and your justice as the noon day sun.
208	（Ps 125:1）	A Song of Ascents. Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion, which can’t be moved, but remains forever.
209	（Isa 30:15）	For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, “You will be saved in returning and rest. Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.” You refused,
210	（Prov 3:5-6）	Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and don’t lean on your own understanding.In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.
211	（John 12:46）	I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.
212	（John 16:27）	for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God.
213	（1John 5:5）	Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
214	（Ps 31:19）	Oh how great is your goodness, which you have laid up for those who fear you, which you have worked for those who take refuge in you, before the sons of men!
215	（Eph 6:16）	above all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.
216	（Prov 3:26）	for Yahweh will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being taken.
217	（Ps 37:40）	Yahweh helps them and rescues them. He rescues them from the wicked and saves them, because they have taken refuge in him.
218	（Ps 18:30）	As for God, his way is perfect. Yahweh’s word is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
219	（1Pet 1:5）	who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
220	（Ps 5:11）	But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice. Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.
221	1.2.{4}	Prayers for Faith
222	（Luke 17:5）	The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”
223	（Mark 9:24）	Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, “I believe. Help my unbelief!”
224	（Luke 22:32）	but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.” [22:32 The word for “brothers” here may be also correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”]
225	1.2.{5}	Faith Affirmations
226	（Acts 15:11）	But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, [15:11 TR adds “Christ”] just as they are.”
227	（1Kgs 8:23-24）	and he said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keeps covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart;who has kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is today.
228	（Ps 31:14）	But I trust in you, Yahweh. I said, “You are my God.”
229	（Isa 25:1）	Yahweh, you are my God. I will exalt you! I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness and truth.
230	（Ps 33:21）	For our heart rejoices in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
231	（Ps 55:23）	But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in you.

236	2.0	Using Scripture to Praise God
237	2.1.0	Beholding the Glory of Christ
238	（2Cor 3:18）	But we all, with unveiled face seeing the glory of the Lord as in a mirror, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit.
239	（Isa 33:17）	Your eyes will see the king in his beauty. They will see a distant land.
240	（Heb 1:3）	His Son is the radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, who, when he had by himself purified us of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high,
241	（Job 16:19）	Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven. He who vouches for me is on high.
242	（Ps 45:7）	You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.
243	（Ps 89:27-29）	I will also appoint him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more. My covenant will stand firm with him.I will also make his offspring endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
244	（Ps 110:1-2）	A Psalm by David. Yahweh says to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet.”Yahweh will send out the rod of your strength out of Zion. Rule among your enemies.
245	（Ps 132:17-18）	I will make the horn of David to bud there. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself, his crown will shine.”
246	（Isa 9:6-7）	For a child is born to us. A son is given to us; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on David’s throne, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.
247	（Isa 11:2-4）	Yahweh’s Spirit will rest on him: the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh.His delight will be in the fear of Yahweh. He will not judge by the sight of his eyes, neither decide by the hearing of his ears;but he will judge the poor with righteousness, and decide with equity for the humble of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.
248	（Isa 11:10-11）	It will happen in that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be glorious.It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
249	（Isa 22:22）	I will lay the key of David’s house on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open.
250	（Isa 42:1-4）	“Behold, my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights: I have put my Spirit on him. He will bring justice to the nations.He will not shout, nor raise his voice, nor cause it to be heard in the street.He won’t break a bruised reed. He won’t quench a dimly burning wick. He will faithfully bring justice.He will not fail nor be discouraged, until he has set justice in the earth, and the islands wait for his law.”
251	（Isa 44:6）	This is what Yahweh, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies, says: “I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God.
252	（Isa 42:6-7）	“I, Yahweh, have called you in righteousness. I will hold your hand. I will keep you, and make you a covenant for the people, as a light for the nations,to open the blind eyes, to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.
253	（Isa 53:5）	But he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought our peace was on him; and by his wounds we are healed.
254	（Isa 53:10-11）	Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him. He has caused him to suffer. When you make his soul an offering for sin, he will see his offspring. He will prolong his days and Yahweh’s pleasure will prosper in his hand.After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light [53:11 So read the Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint. Masoretic Text omits “the light”.] and be satisfied. My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself; and he will bear their iniquities.
255	（Isa 55:5）	Behold, you shall call a nation that you don’t know; and a nation that didn’t know you shall run to you, because of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.”
256	（Isa 61:1-2）	The Lord Yahweh’s Spirit is on me, because Yahweh has anointed me to preach good news to the humble. He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and release to those who are bound,to proclaim the year of Yahweh’s favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,
257	（Heb 4:14-16）	Having then a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let’s hold tightly to our confession.For we don’t have a high priest who can’t be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.Let’s therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for help in time of need.
258	（Jer 23:6）	In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell safely. This is his name by which he will be called: Yahweh our righteousness.
259	（Jer 33:22）	As the army of the sky can’t be counted, and the sand of the sea can’t be measured; so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’”
260	（Ezek 1:26）	Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire [1:26 or, lapis lazuli] stone. On the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above.
261	（Ezek 1:28）	As the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of Yahweh’s glory. When I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.
262	（Ezek 34:23）	I will set up one shepherd over them, and he will feed them, even my servant David. He will feed them, and he will be their shepherd.
263	（Ezek 37:24）	“‘“My servant David will be king over them. They all will have one shepherd. They will also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.
264	（Hos 3:5）	Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days.
265	（Dan 7:13-14）	“I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.Dominion was given him, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom that which will not be destroyed.
266	（Mic 5:2）	But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, being small among the clans of Judah, out of you one will come out to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings out are from of old, from ancient times.
267	（Mic 5:4-5）	He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh, in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God: and they will live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth.He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land, and when he marches through our fortresses, then we will raise against him seven shepherds, and eight leaders of men.
268	（Zech 12:10）	I will pour on David’s house, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplication; and they will look to me [12:10 After “me”, the Hebrew has the two letters “Aleph Tav” (the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet), not as a word, but as a grammatical marker.] whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and will grieve bitterly for him, as one grieves for his firstborn.
269	（Jas 2:1）	My brothers, don’t hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality.
270	（Col 3:4）	When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.
271	（Mark 10:45）	For the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
272	（Luke 1:32）	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
273	（Luke 19:10）	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.”
274	（Luke 22:69）	From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”
275	（John 1:14）	The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.
276	（John 5:19）	Jesus therefore answered them, “Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.
277	（John 10:11）	I am the good shepherd. [10:11 Isaiah 40:11 ; Ezekiel 34:11-12,15,22 ] The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
278	（John 10:14-15）	I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I’m known by my own;even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.
279	（Acts 2:23）	him, being delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of lawless men, crucified and killed;
280	（Acts 4:12）	There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven that is given among men, by which we must be saved!”
281	（Acts 10:38）	even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
282	（Gal 1:3-4）	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—
283	（Phil 2:9-11）	Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name,that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
284	（Col 2:2-3）	that their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding, that they may know the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.
285	（Titus 2:13-14）	looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.
286	（Heb 1:8）	But of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom.
287	（Heb 2:10）	For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
288	（Heb 2:16-18）	For most certainly, he doesn’t give help to angels, but he gives help to the offspring [2:16 or, seed] of Abraham.Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
289	（Heb 4:14-15）	Having then a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let’s hold tightly to our confession.For we don’t have a high priest who can’t be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.
290	（Heb 5:7-9）	He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,
291	（Heb 7:16）	who has been made, not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an endless life;
292	（Heb 7:25）	Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them.
293	（Heb 9:14）	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without defect to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
294	（Heb 10:12-13）	but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God,from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.
295	（1John 2:2）	And he is the atoning sacrifice [2:2 “atoning sacrifice” is from the Greek “ιλασμος”, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means of appeasement or propitiation—the sacrifice that turns away God’s wrath because of our sin. ] for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
296	（Rev 1:5）	and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and washed us from our sins by his blood—
297	（Rev 1:16）	He had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.
298	（Rev 1:18）	and the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever. Amen. I have the keys of Death and of Hades. [1:18 or, Hell]
299	（Rev 5:4-7）	Then I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look in it.One of the elders said to me, “Don’t weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome: he who opens the book and its seven seals.”I saw in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.

603	（Luke 19:10）	For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.”
604	（John 5:24-25）	“Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life, and doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.Most certainly I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God’s voice; and those who hear will live.
605	（John 6:37）	All those whom the Father gives me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out.
606	（John 6:65）	He said, “For this cause I have said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.”
607	（John 10:9）	I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.
608	（John 11:25-26）	Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even if he dies.Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
609	（John 14:6）	Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.
610	（John 20:31）	but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.
611	（Acts 2:38-39）	Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.”
612	（Acts 3:19-20）	“Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord,and that he may send Christ Jesus, who was ordained for you before,
613	（Acts 11:18）	When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, “Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!”
614	（Acts 13:38）	Be it known to you therefore, brothers, [13:38 The word for “brothers” here and where the context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”] that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,
615	（Acts 16:31）	They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.”
616	（Acts 26:18）	to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’
617	（Rom 1:16）	For I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ, because it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first, and also for the Greek.
618	（Rom 4:5）	But to him who doesn’t work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.
619	（Rom 5:1）	Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;
620	（Rom 5:8）	But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
621	（Rom 8:1）	There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don’t walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. [8:1 NU omits “who don’t walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit”]
622	（Rom 9:16）	So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.
623	（Rom 10:4）	For Christ is the fulfillment [10:4 or, completion, or end] of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
624	（Rom 10:9）	that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
625	（Rom 10:12-13）	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.For, “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.” [10:13 Joel 2:32 ]
626	（Rom 10:17）	So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
627	（1Cor 1:18）	For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
628	（1Cor 15:22）	For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
629	（1Cor 15:49）	As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let’s [15:49 NU, TR read “we will” instead of “let’s”] also bear the image of the heavenly.
630	（2Cor 5:19）	namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.
631	（2Cor 5:21）	For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
632	（1Thess 5:9）	For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
633	（Eph 2:8-9）	for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,not of works, that no one would boast.
634	（1Tim 2:3-4）	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.
635	（2Tim 1:10）	but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.
636	（Titus 3:5-6）	not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;
637	（Heb 7:25）	Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them.
638	（Heb 8:10-12）	“For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel. After those days,” says the Lord; “I will put my laws into their mind, I will also write them on their heart. I will be their God, and they will be my people.They will not teach every man his fellow citizen, [8:11 TR reads “neighbor” instead of “fellow citizen”] and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for all will know me, from their least to their greatest.For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness. I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.” [8:12 Jeremiah 31:31-34 ]
639	（Heb 9:26）	or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
640	（Heb 10:14）	For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.
641	（2Pet 3:9）	The Lord is not slow concerning his promise, as some count slowness; but he is patient with us, not wishing that anyone should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
642	（1John 5:11-12）	The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.He who has the Son has the life. He who doesn’t have God’s Son doesn’t have the life.
643	（1John 5:20）	We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
644	（Rev 1:5）	and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and washed us from our sins by his blood—
645	（Rev 22:17）	The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” He who hears, let him say, “Come!” He who is thirsty, let him come. He who desires, let him take the water of life freely.

His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”But he answered, “I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”But he answered, “It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.
1963	6.1.2	The cross of Christ generates faith.
1964	（Rom 10:17）	So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
1965	（Rom 8:31-32）	What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?He who didn’t spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?
1966	6.1.3	The promises of Scripture generate faith
1967	（Heb 11:6）	Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.
1968	（Rom 4:19-21）	Without being weakened in faith, he didn’t consider his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.Yet, looking to the promise of God, he didn’t waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God,and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was also able to perform.
1969	（Heb 11:26）	considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.
1970	（Ps 9:10）	Those who know your name will put their trust in you, for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.
1971	6.2.0	Faith and the Prayerful Use of Promises
1972	（2Sam 7:21）	For your word’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
1973	（2Cor 6:16-7:1）	What agreement does a temple of God have with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, “I will dwell in them and walk in them. I will be their God and they will be my people.” [6:16 Leviticus 26:12 ; Jeremiah 32:38 ; Ezekiel 37:27 ]Therefore “‘Come out from among them, and be separate,’ says the Lord. ‘Touch no unclean thing. I will receive you. [6:17 Isaiah 52:11 ; Ezekiel 20:34,41 ]I will be to you a Father. You will be to me sons and daughters,’ says the Lord Almighty.” [6:18 2 Samuel 7:14 ; 7:8 ]Having therefore these promises, beloved, let’s cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
1974	（2Pet 1:3-4）	seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue,by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust.
1975	（Eph 3:6）	that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,
1976	（2Cor 1:19-20）	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not “Yes and no,” but in him is “Yes.”For however many are the promises of God, in him is the “Yes.” Therefore also through him is the “Amen”, to the glory of God through us.
1977	（Rom 4:16）	For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the offspring, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
1978	（Gal 3:16）	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring. [3:16 or, seed] He doesn’t say, “To descendants [3:16 or, seeds]”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”, [3:16 Genesis 12:7 ; 13:15 ; 24:7 ] which is Christ.
1979	（Jer 33:14-16）	“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.“In those days and at that time, I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David. He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell safely. This is the name by which she will be called: Yahweh our righteousness.”
1980	（Ezek 12:28）	“Therefore tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “None of my words will be deferred any more, but the word which I speak will be performed,” says the Lord Yahweh.’”

1982	（Heb 6:12）	that you won’t be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherited the promises.
1983	（Heb 6:15）	Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
1984	（Heb 10:35-36）	Therefore don’t throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise.
1985	（Heb 11:33）	who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, [11:33 Daniel 6:22-23 ]
1986	（Gen 31:3）	Yahweh said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”
1987	（Gen 32:9）	Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’

1989	（Exod 32:11-13）	Moses begged Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?Why should the Egyptians talk, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and turn away from this evil against your people.Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring [32:13 or, seed] as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’”
1990	（Ps 77:7-10）	“Will the Lord reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more?Has his loving kindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations?Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?” Selah.Then I thought, “I will appeal to this: the years of the right hand of the Most High.”
1991	（2Sam 7:20-21）	What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord Yahweh.For your word’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.
1992	（2Sam 7:25）	Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as you have spoken.
1993	（2Sam 7:28-29）	“Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord Yahweh, have spoken it. Let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing.”
1994	（Dan 9:2-3）	in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, understood by the books the number of the years about which Yahweh’s word [9:2 “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations. ] came to Jeremiah the prophet, for the accomplishing of the desolations of Jerusalem, even seventy years.I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and petitions, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
1995	（Neh 1:8-9）	“Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you trespass, I will scatter you among the peoples;but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.’
