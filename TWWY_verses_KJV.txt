26	（Gen 32:12）	And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
27	（Gen 32:9）	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
28	（2Cor 1:20）	For all the promises of God in him [are] yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.
29	（2Cor 6:1）	We then, as workers together [with him,] beseech [you] also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
30	（2Cor 6:16）	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
31	（Lev 26:12）	And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
32	（Exod 32:27）	And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, [and] go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
33	（Isa 52:11）	Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean [thing]; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.
34	（2Cor 7:1）	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
35	（Gal 3:16）	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
36	（Gal 3:29）	And if ye [be] Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
37	0.6.0	Four Important Truths
38	0.6.1	Promises will only and always mean what they mean in their context and with the intent with which they were written.
39	（Matt 4:5-7）	Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in [their] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
40	0.6.2	Promises sometimes have a multiple fulfillment in the past, present and future.
41	（Joel 2:29-32）	And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.
42	（Acts 2:15）	For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is [but] the third hour of the day.
43	（Rev 6:12）	And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
44	（Isa 7:10-16）	Moreover the LORD spoke again unto Ahaz, saying,Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; [Is it] a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.
45	（Matt 1:21-23）	And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
46	0.6.3	Promises that are conditional always require fulfillment of the condition before the promise is granted.
47	（Ps 50:14-15）	Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
48	（Matt 6:33）	But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
49	0.6.4	Promises that are granted are sometimes delayed for many years.
50	（Ps 69:13）	But as for me, my prayer [is] unto thee, O LORD, [in] an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
51	（Heb 6:15）	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
52	0.7.0	Living Before the Face of God
53	（Ps 89:15-16）	Blessed [is] the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
54	（Gal 5:25）	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

76	（Ps 39:7）	And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope [is] in thee.
77	（Ps 71:14）	But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
78	（Rom 6:13）	Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.
